This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(hflights)
hflights <- tbl_df(hflights)
```

This loads the libraries and converts the hflights data into a dplyr tbl.  Now let's take a look at the data:

```{r}
glimpse(hflights)
```

Now let's try some piping in dplyr.  This is a simple way to pass arguments in succession to reach a result.  For example, if I wanted to group the hflights data by UniqueCarrier to get the average ArrDelay and then sort by avgArrDelay I could do the following:

```{r}
#1 Grab data
#2 Remove NAs
#3 Group by UniqueCarrier
#4 Get the average ArrDelay
#5 Sort result

 hflights %>% #1
  na.omit() %>% #2
  group_by(UniqueCarrier) %>% #3
  summarise(avgArrDelay = mean(ArrDelay)) %>% #4
  arrange(desc(avgArrDelay)) #5
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
hflights_no_na <- na.omit(hflights)
plot(hflights_no_na$Distance, hflights_no_na$ArrDelay)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
